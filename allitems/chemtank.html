                    <br>Not only does it give you the opportunity to run SUPER fast towards people you hate. 
                    <br>The person you hate has to be within 24 meters radius. 
                    <br>Using this can let you ram the shit out of the person  you genuinely dislike
                    <br>This one can be pretty expensive tho considering it costs 3200 gold!
