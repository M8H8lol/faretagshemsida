                    Now this item is an interesting one. Guardians angel provided you with an extra life. This item has a 5 minute cooldown ingame but in this case its a 5 years cooldown. So use it wisely
                    <br>So when you have this item with you and something lethal happends to you, you will be gained another life which is kind of self self explanatory.
                    <br>So using this item should not be seen as some kind of joke considering how long it takes for the item to refunction again.
                    <br>This item has the price of 2800 gold so its definitely not cheap
