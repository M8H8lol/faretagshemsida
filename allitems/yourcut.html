                    Now this item is more of a reward instead of a item. 
                    <br>So basically what it does is that it gives you gold when you assist in something. 
                    <br>So lets say someone needs help lifting something heavy up the stairs. Having this with you lets you get 300 gold every time you assist someone on anything during your daily life.
                    <br>So this item is more of a reward system it does not come with a price. 
                    <br>Everytime you assist someone, you get 300 gold.
