                    Now this item can provide all kinds of people with all kinds of different buffs. 
                    <br>Only by looking at its stats it can provide you good stuff. It gives you attack damage, ability haste, attack speed and health.
                    <br>So lets say you're a boxer then this item would provide you with the perfect stats. 
                    <br>Your attacks will hit harder and faster, you can take more of a hit because of the increased health and you can use your bigger attacks (such as a jumping kick) more often because of the ability haste.
                    <br>Although it is pretty expensive, I think specifically for boxers, this item would be a perfect fit for the price of 3333 gold!
